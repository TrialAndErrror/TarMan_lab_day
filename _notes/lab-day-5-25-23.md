# Project Idea: 
- Write "TarMan", a tarball manager GUI that you can use for zipping and unzipping stuff in your filesystem.

# Setup
- Python
	- tar module, standard library
- Textual/Rich

## Start
- Tar two files together
- Untar them
- Verify that you've got the same data

## Next Steps
- Basic gui showing progress
- Interactive gui allowing you to set config options
- File Selection GUI

## GUI Ideas
- File selection box
- Output / Input Destination Choice
- Directory (multiple) selection window
- Shift click / commands

## Future State
- Peek into archives and view contents
- Extract individual files from archive
- Multiple tarfile extracts into unique folders
- Move files?
- "Signing" the file to verify that I made the zipped file
- SEcurity & Encryption
- File transfer to web-based API

## Goals
- Be able to run in any directory, and make copies of files in those directories in or out of compressed form
- Create tarball from files
- Create tarball from folders
- Extract tarball with just files in it
- Extract tarball with files and folders in it
