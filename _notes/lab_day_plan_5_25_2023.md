How to organize my lab day project. Part 1

* Step 1: Plan things out
* Step 2: Add context to the plan
* Step 3: Identify the resources you need access to
* Step 4: Identify the most small piece of the puzzle and understand what you need to make that work
* Step 5: Identify the things you aren't working on, and put those to the side
* Step 6: Imagine a test that proves that your thing works
* Step 7: Write that test
* Step 8: Watch your test fail and look at what fails first.
* Step 9: Write features narrowly tailored to those failures
* Step 10: Ruin the test suite again and see what fails
* Step 11: repeat voraciously until your program pretty much works
* Step 12: Find the thread to pull to make it break, and then fix that
* Step 13: Remember that list of things you aren't working on? You have time for those now
* Step 14: Decide not to do those things, and move on to other projects
* Step 15: Lie awake at night and think about those features and how cool they would be
* Step 16: Who needs sleep, just get up and do it and make it work
* Step 17: Drinking your coffee with your head held high because you shipped working features that you don't have to worry about failing in the wild 
* Step 18: Well, just not failing as much
* Step 19: Bugs. All the bugs.
* Step 20: Aaand, that's a wrap! We';re done supporting it, it was just a lab day project anyways , so no guarantee that i'll actually finish fixing everything 
* Optional Step 21: Open source, anyone? Count me in!
